# Popular_Movie_ML_Project
ðŸŽ¬ Movie Popularity Prediction
This project showcases a complete machine learning pipeline aimed at predicting whether a movie will be popular based on various features. Using classification algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, the model analyzes real-world movie data sourced from Kaggle.

The objective is to offer a clear, beginner-friendly walkthrough of building a predictive model â€” from data preparation to evaluation â€” while highlighting key steps in the machine learning workflow.
